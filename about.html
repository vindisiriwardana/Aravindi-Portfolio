    <h1>About Me</h1>
 <p>
        I am an enthusiastic Information Technology undergraduate currently pursuing 
        a Bachelor of Science (Hons) in Information Technology at SLIIT. 
        I am passionate about building user-friendly web applications 
        and solving real-world problems through technology.
    </p>

    <p>
        My technical expertise includes Full-Stack Web Development using 
        MERN stack, Java development, MySQL database management, and 
        Software Testing methodologies including Manual Testing and Agile Testing.
        I have hands-on experience working with modern development tools 
        such as Visual Studio Code, Eclipse, GitHub, and Apache Tomcat.
    </p>
<br>
    <p>
        Throughout my academic journey, I have contributed to several projects 
        including a Travel and Tourism Management System, Online Gaming Web Application, 
        and a Hotel Reservation System. In these projects, I actively supported 
        full CRUD operations, user profile management, cart systems, and 
        rental handling features.
    </p>

    <p>
        I also hold certifications in Agile Testing, ISTQB Foundation preparation, 
        Apache POI Masterclass, Manual Testing, and Data Engineering Foundations, 
        which have strengthened my understanding of software quality assurance, 
        structured development processes, and data management concepts.
    </p>

    <p>
        I am a creative and analytical thinker who enjoys continuous learning 
        and adapting to new technologies. My goal is to grow as a Full-Stack Developer 
        or Quality Engineering professional while contributing to innovative, 
        scalable, and efficient software solutions.
